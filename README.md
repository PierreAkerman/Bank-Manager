# Bank-Manager
CASE - Bank management application in Azure (Webbutveckling - KYH).Net21

This is a school project required by the backend course in web development. The application allows users (admin & cashier) to administrate customers, accounts and different types of transactions. This project was built with a code first approach as an ASP.NET Core application, customers are seeded to the database on startup, so to run this on your machine you must configure your connectionstring.
This solution includes a unit test project, that tests all transaction methods in ITransactionService.
